### Suggestions
To increase the chances of your PR being accepted, follow these suggestions:

 - Lint with pylint, pycodestyle, and pydocstyle.
 - Use windows (CR LF) line endings.

### Requirements
Your PR will not be accepted if it does not follow these requirements:

 - Is both Windows and Linux compatible (I can test this if you can't; macOS compatibility would be nice but isn't required).
 - The Travis build passes.
 - It's formatted with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).
 - It doesn't expand the scope of the project beyond what I am comfortable managing (I will be the judge of this, if you're unsure just go ahead and submit it anyway).
